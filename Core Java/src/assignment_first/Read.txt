I would love to say that a dog is a man’s friend, but then that is too mainstream. Because, dogs are, in fact, a lot more than just best friends. They are tiny souls, much more affectionate than you and I have ever been or will ever be to our best friends or mankind at large. And if there were a job where you could change word meanings in dictionaries, I would take it up only to swap the meaning of ‘dog’ from a ‘domesticated carnivorous mammal’ to a ‘selfless angel, who gives away his/her life expecting nothing in return but ample amount of love.’

And these heart-warming stories of dogs from around the world completely justify that they are nothing but devoted and selfless fellow-members. Following are some of the dogs documented for having stayed faithful to their masters even after their death.
